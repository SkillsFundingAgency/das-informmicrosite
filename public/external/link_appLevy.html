<p>In spring 2017 the way the government funds apprenticeships in
England is changing. Some employers will be required to contribute
to a new apprenticeship levy, and there will be changes to the
funding for apprenticeship training for all employers.</p>
<p>The apprenticeship levy requires all employers operating in the
UK, with a pay bill over Â£3 million each year, to make an
investment in apprenticeships. You can benefit from this investment
by training apprentices.</p>
<p>This guidance provides information on how the apprenticeship
levy will work, from when it is introduced on 6 April 2017.</p>
<p>It also explains the principles that apprenticeship funding will
operate on from 1 May 2017, whether you pay the levy or not.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the benefits apprenticeships can
bring to your organisation and about the ways apprenticeships are
being reformed, in our <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-in-england-vision-for-2020">
vision for apprenticeships</a>. The reforms include giving
employers the opportunity to add to the new <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-standards-list-of-occupations-available">
apprenticeship standards already available</a> by <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-of-apprenticeships-in-england-guidance-for-trailblazers">
developing standards</a> that meet their precise needs.</p>
<h3 id="who-this-guidance-applies-to">Who this guidance applies
to</h3>
<p>This guidance is for all employers operating in the UK, whether
you pay the apprenticeship levy or not.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re an employer with operations in Scotland, Wales or
Northern Ireland, you may also want to contact your apprenticeship
authority:</p>

<h3 id="further-guidance">Further guidance</h3>
<p><a href="#when-further-information-will-be-available">We will
publish further guidance</a> on the levy and the new system for
funding apprenticeships in October and December 2016.</p>
<h2 id="paying-the-apprenticeship-levy">Paying the apprenticeship
levy</h2>
<p>(This applies to all employers who operate in the UK).</p>
<p>You will need to pay the apprenticeship levy if you are an
employer, in any sector, with a pay bill of more than Â£3 million
each year. For the purposes of the levy, an â€˜employerâ€™ is someone
who is a secondary contributor, with liability to pay Class 1
secondary National Insurance contributions (<abbr title=
"National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>) for their
employees.</p>
<p>The levy will be charged at a rate of 0.5% of your annual pay
bill. You will have a levy allowance of Â£15,000 per year to offset
against the levy you must pay. This means you will only pay the
levy if your pay bill exceeds Â£3 million in a given year.</p>
<p>You will pay the levy to HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title=
"Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) through the Pay as
You Earn (<abbr title="Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) process.</p>
<h3 id="what-counts-as-your-pay-bill">What counts as your pay
bill</h3>
<p>Your pay bill will be based on the total amount of earnings
subject to Class 1 secondary <abbr title=
"National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. Although earnings
below the secondary threshold are not counted when calculating an
employerâ€™s <abbr title=
"National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, they will be
included for the purposes of calculating the amount of levy the
employer needs to pay.</p>
<p>Earnings include any remuneration or profit coming from
employment, such as wages, bonuses, commissions, and pension
contributions that you pay <abbr title=
"National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> on. We will not
charge the levy on other payments such as benefits in kind, subject
to Class 1A <abbr title=
"National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>
<h3 id="calculating-what-you-have-to-pay">Calculating what you have
to pay</h3>
<p>You will pay the levy on your entire pay bill at a rate of 0.5%.
However, you will have a levy allowance to offset against this. The
levy allowance is worth Â£15,000 for each tax year. This means the
levy is only payable on pay bills over Â£3 million (because 0.5% x
Â£3 million = Â£15,000).</p>
<p>The levy allowance will operate on a monthly basis and will
accumulate throughout the year. This means you will have an
allowance of Â£1,250 a month. Any unused allowance will be carried
from one month to the next. For example, if your levy liability in
month 1 is Â£1,000 you will not pay the levy and your allowance in
month 2 will be Â£1,500.</p>
<p>If you have some unused allowance in a month, but paid the levy
previously in the tax year, you can receive a credit which you can
use to offset against your other <abbr title=
"Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr> liabilities. The credit will also
reduce the amount of levy paid.</p>
<p>If you have multiple <abbr title="Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr>
schemes and do not use the full Â£15,000 allowance, you will be able
to offset the unused amount against another one of your schemes
once the tax year has ended.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-what-you-will-pay">Examples of what you will
pay</h3>
<h4 id="example-1-an-employer-who-would-pay-the-levy">Example 1: an
employer who would pay the levy</h4>
<p>An employer with an annual pay bill of Â£5,000,000:</p>
<ul>
<li>levy sum: 0.5% x Â£5,000,000 = Â£25,000</li>
<li>subtracting levy allowance: Â£25,000 - Â£15,000 = Â£10,000 annual
levy payment</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example-2-an-employer-who-would-not-have-to-pay-the-levy">
Example 2: an employer who would not have to pay the levy</h4>
<p>An employer with an annual pay bill of Â£2,000,000:</p>
<ul>
<li>levy sum: 0.5% x Â£2,000,000 = Â£10,000</li>
<li>subtracting levy allowance: Â£10,000 - Â£15,000 = Â£0 annual levy
payment</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <a rel="external" href=
"https://estimate-my-apprenticeship-funding.sfa.bis.gov.uk/">indicative
online tool for employers</a> to estimate your levy contribution,
begin to plan your training requirements, and estimate your
financial spending.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-pay-the-levy">How to pay the levy</h3>
<p>You will calculate, report and pay your levy to <abbr title=
"Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, through the
<abbr title="Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr> process alongside tax and
<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>
<p>If you have calculated that you will pay the apprenticeship
levy, you will need to declare this and include it in your usual
<abbr title="Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr> payment to <abbr title=
"Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by the 19th (or
22nd if you report electronically) of the following month. The
first submission in which you will declare that you will pay the
levy will therefore be in May.</p>
<h3 id="corporation-tax-deduction">Corporation Tax deduction</h3>
<p>Any apprenticeship levy payment to <abbr title=
"Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will be allowable
for Corporation Tax.</p>
<h3 id="calculating-the-levy-for-connected-companies-or-charities">
Calculating the levy for connected companies or charities</h3>
<p>Where a group of employers are connected they will only be able
to use one Â£15,000 levy allowance. The definition of connected
companies and charities is based on the <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employment-allowance-more-detailed-guidance">
definition used with the Employment Allowance</a>.</p>
<p>If you are part of a group of connected employers, you must
decide what proportion of the levy allowance each employer in the
group will be entitled to. This decision must be taken at the
beginning of the tax year and will be fixed for that tax year,
unless a correction is necessary because the total amount of the
levy allowance claimed across the group exceeds Â£15,000. Each
employer in the group will then calculate what they have to pay
through the same processes set out above, but using only their
portion of the Â£15,000 levy allowance.</p>
<h3 id=
"employers-who-already-pay-into-an-existing-industry-levy-scheme">
Employers who already pay into an existing industry levy
scheme</h3>
<p>Some industries already operate levy systems, or other
collective training arrangements. If you already contribute to one
of these, you will still be required to pay the apprenticeship
levy.</p>
<p>The Industry Training Boards for the construction, engineering
construction and film industries will consult their members on
potential changes to their existing levy arrangements.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-money-paid-under-the-apprenticeship-levy">
Accessing money paid under the apprenticeship levy</h2>
<p>Once you have declared the levy to <abbr title=
"Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> you will be able to
access funding for apprenticeships through a new digital
apprenticeship service account.</p>
<p>You will be able to use this to pay for training and assessment
for apprentices in England. The service will also help you find
training providers to help you develop and deliver your

<p>Separate arrangements will be in place in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-account-to-access-your-funds">Creating an
account to access your funds</h3>
<p>Online tools for employers will be available via the digital
apprenticeship service over the next year. You will be able to
register to create your account from January 2017 and youâ€™ll be
able to familiarise yourself with the service.</p>
<p>When youâ€™ve registered, youâ€™ll need to verify your <abbr title=
"Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes and link them to your
account. You will be able to use more than one account if youâ€™d
like to keep your schemes separate.</p>
<h3 id="when-funds-will-appear-in-your-digital-account">When funds
will appear in your digital account</h3>
<p>The apprenticeship levy will be introduced on 6 April 2017. The
first time eligible employers will have to declare their liability
to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will
be in May 2017 for levy due on their April payroll. Levy-paying
employers will be able to see corresponding funds in their digital
accounts shortly after their final declaration to <abbr title=
"Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, so after 22
May.</p>
<p>To simplify the employer experience of the new apprenticeship
funding system we are proposing that the new system for funding
apprenticeships comes into effect from 1 May 2017. Any
apprenticeships started from this date will be funded according to
the new rules. Until this date, the funding system in place for
frameworks and standards will continue to operate.</p>
<h3 id=
"employers-who-operate-in-england-and-other-parts-of-the-uk">
Employers who operate in England and other parts of the UK</h3>
<p>The levy will apply to employers across the UK.</p>
<p>The amount entering your digital apprenticeship service account
will be how much you have available to <a href=
"#employers-with-operations-across-uk">spend on apprenticeship
training in England</a>.</p>
<p>Apprenticeships are a devolved policy, which means that
authorities in each of the UK nations manage their own
apprenticeship programmes, including how funding is spent on
apprenticeship training.</p>
<p>The digital apprenticeship service will support the English
apprenticeship system. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have
their own arrangements for supporting employers to access
apprenticeships.</p>
<p>To calculate how much you will have to spend through the English
system, we plan to use data that we already hold about the home
address of your employees. Weâ€™ll use this data to work out what
proportion of your pay bill is paid to employees living in England.
Weâ€™ll make this assessment in early 2017 and will announce the
exact date in advance.</p>
<p>Employers can update their employeesâ€™ address as part of their
Real Time Information returns.</p>
<p>We are testing the accuracy and suitability of this approach and
will provide more details in October 2016.</p>
<h3 id="top-ups-to-the-funds-in-your-digital-account">Top-ups to
the funds in your digital account</h3>
<p>We will apply a 10% top-up to the funds you have for spending on
apprenticeship training in England. We will apply the top-up
monthly, at the same time the funds enter your digital account.</p>
<p>That means for every Â£1 that enters your digital account to
spend in England on apprenticeship training, you get Â£1.10.</p>
<h3 id="expiry-of-funds-in-your-digital-account">Expiry of funds in
your digital account</h3>
<p>Funds will expire 18 months after they enter your digital
account unless you spend them on apprenticeship training. This will
also apply to any top-ups in your digital account. For example,
funds entering your account in September 2017 will expire in March
2019, unless you have spent them. Money is spent when it leaves
your digital account as a payment to a training provider.</p>
<p>The account will work on a first-in, first-out basis, through
either payment or expiry. Whenever a payment is taken from your
digital account it will automatically use the funds that entered
your account first. This will minimise the amount of expired
funds.</p>
<p>This will happen automatically. Your digital account will let
you know in good time when any funds are due to expire so that you
can arrange to spend them if you wish.</p>
<h3 id="directing-funds-in-a-digital-account-to-another-employer">
Directing funds in a digital account to another employer</h3>
<p>In the first year of the levy, you will be able to use the funds
in your digital account to pay for apprenticeship training and
assessment for your own employees. The main aim of the
apprenticeship levy is to support employers in growing the number
and quality of apprenticeships in their own workforce.</p>
<p>We know that some employers will want to use funds in their
digital account to pay for apprenticeship training of other
employerâ€™s apprentices, for example, someone in their supply
chain.</p>
<p>We are seeking views on proposals to allow employers to transfer
10% of their funds to another employerâ€™s digital account from 2018.

Pooling funds in a digital account with other employers in a group
structure</h3>
<p>If you are in a group of companies connected for the purposes of
paying the levy, your group will be able to collect their funds
together into one digital account. Your group will do this by
registering to have <abbr title="Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr>
schemes attached to a single digital account.</p>
<p>Since you can only use funds in your digital account to pay for
apprenticeship training for your own employees, employers that are
not connected will not be able to pool funds in a digital
account.</p>
<h3 id="apprenticeship-training-agencies">Apprenticeship training
agencies</h3>
<p>As an apprenticeship training agency (<abbr title=
"apprenticeship training agency">ATA</abbr>) usually employs
apprentices themselves, they will need to pay the levy if their pay
bill is above Â£3 million per year. This means they will be able to
use funds in their own digital account to pay for training and
assessment costs.</p>
<p>Where <abbr title="apprenticeship training agencies">ATAs</abbr>
do not pay the levy, they will be able to access support for
training and assessment on the same basis as other employers who
donâ€™t pay the levy.</p>
<p>We know that some employers will want to use the funds in their
digital account to pay for training of apprentices employed by an
<abbr title="apprenticeship training agency">ATA</abbr>. We are
seeking views on proposals to allow employers to transfer 10% of
their funds to an <abbr title=

<p>This means that in the first year of the new system, levied
employers will not be able to transfer digital funds to pay for
training of apprentices employed by <abbr title=

to use their digital funds for training will only be able to do so
for individuals in their direct employment.</p>

place at the time the apprenticeship started.</p>
<p>This will be the case for apprentices following programmes

â€˜apprenticeship standardsâ€™. Where the apprenticeship requires you

<p>When the new funding system begins in May 2017, you can choose

to spread it over the life time of the apprenticeship. As both you
and the government make a payment, we call this
â€˜co-investmentâ€™.</p>
<p>Every individual apprenticeship framework and standard will be

will cap the maximum price that government will â€˜co-investâ€™

<p>You will need to choose the training youâ€™d like your apprentice

can either be on a new apprenticeship standard, or on an existing
apprenticeship framework. These are the 2 different types of
apprenticeship training.</p>
<p><a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/apprenticeship-standards">
Apprenticeship standards</a> are the new type of apprenticeship
developed by employers. Each standard covers a specific job role
and sets out the core skills, knowledge and behaviours an
apprentice will need to be fully competent in their job role and
meet the needs of employers in the sector. Standards are developed
by employer groups known as <a href=

â€˜trailblazersâ€™</a>.</p>
<p>An <a rel="external" href=

vocational and professional qualifications, with workplace and
classroom based training. We will phase out frameworks between now

Apprenticeship Service can provide all the information you need to
know in order to <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/take-on-an-apprentice">employ an
apprentice</a>.</p>
<p>You can also read more about <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-become-a-training-provider">
how to set up your organisation to deliver apprenticeship training
for your own employees</a>.</p>
<h3 id="funding-training-and-assessment-costs">Funding training and
assessment costs</h3>
<p>All existing and new apprenticeship frameworks and standards
will be placed within a funding band. The upper limit of each
funding band will cap the maximum amount of digital funds an
employer who pays the levy can use towards an individual
apprenticeship. The upper limit of the funding bands will also cap
the maximum price that government will â€˜co-investâ€™ towards, where
an employer does not pay the levy or has insufficient digital funds
and is eligible for extra support. It will be up to employers to
negotiate prices with providers, within these funding limits.</p>
<p>The same funding bands will apply to all employers paying for
apprenticeship training.</p>
<h3 id="levy-paying-employers">Levy-paying employers</h3>
<p>You will be asked to negotiate and agree a price with the
training provider you have chosen from the approved register. This
price will cover the delivery of apprenticeship training towards a
specific standard or framework, and the cost of assessing the
apprentice at the end of their apprenticeship.</p>
<p>You can use funds in your digital account to pay your training
provider, up to the maximum allowed by the relevant funding
band.</p>
<p>For example, the apprenticeship standard you have chosen is in a
funding band with a limit of Â£6,000 and you negotiate a price of
Â£5,000 with your training provider. We will deduct this amount from
your digital account, in monthly instalments, over the life of the
apprenticeship.</p>
<p>If you negotiate a price with a training provider that is more
than the maximum allowed by the funding band, then you must pay the
difference between the band maximum and the agreed price, in full.
You canâ€™t make this payment from your digital account.</p>
<h3 id="employers-that-dont-pay-the-levy-1">Employers that donâ€™t
pay the levy</h3>
<p>You will negotiate and agree a price with the training provider
you have chosen from the approved register. This price will cover
the delivery of apprenticeship training towards a specific standard
or framework, and the cost of assessing the apprentice at the end
of their apprenticeship. You pay for this through co-investment
with us.</p>
<p>Co-investment means that you and the government each pay some of
the money to the provider. There will be a rate set each year, for
the proportion of the money that you need to pay and the proportion
the government will pay.</p>
<p>We are seeking views on proposals that government pays 90% and
employers pay the remaining 10%. You can <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-proposals-for-funding-from-may-2017">
learn more about this proposal and feed in your views</a>. We will
confirm the co-investment rate in October 2016.</p>
<p>Your payment plus the government contribution cannot total more
than the maximum allowed by the funding band for the standard or
framework you have chosen.</p>
<p>If you negotiate a price with a provider that is more than the
maximum allowed by the funding band, then you must pay the
difference between the band maximum and the agreed price, in full.
You wonâ€™t get government support towards these costs.</p>
<h3 id=
"extra-support-for-employing-16--to-18-year-old-apprentices--all-employers">
Extra support for employing 16- to 18-year-old apprentices â€“ all
employers</h3>
<p>When you take on an apprentice who is aged between 16 and 18 at
the start of their apprenticeship, you will receive a payment to
help meet the extra costs of employing them. This will be paid to
you through the training provider.</p>
<p>We are seeking views on proposals that employers and providers
both receive Â£1,000 when they take on a 16- to 18-year-old
apprentice. You can <a href=

<h3 id=
"extra-support-for-employing-apprentices-with-additional-needs--all-employers">
Extra support for employing apprentices with additional needs â€“ all
employers</h3>
<p>To help meet extra costs, you will receive the same payment as
you do when you recruit a 16- to 18-year-old apprentice, if you
recruit:</p>
<ul>
<li>an apprentice who is aged between 19 and 24 and who has an
<a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help">
education, health and care plan</a> provided by the local
authority</li>
<li>a 19- to 24-year-old who has been in the care of the local

<p>If you recruit an apprentice with additional learning needs
(such as dyslexia), or other learning difficulties or disabilities,
we will make a payment directly to the training provider to help
them with the extra costs of supporting the apprenticeâ€™s
learning.</p>
<p>We are seeking views on proposals that learning providers should
be able to claim costs from government up to an additional Â£150
each month for these apprentices. Where there is evidence of
greater learning support needed then additional funding may be
provided. You can <a href=

<h3 id="funding-for-english-and-maths-training--all-employers">
Funding for English and maths training â€“ all employers</h3>
<p>Apprentices have to meet a minimum standard in both English and
maths up to level 2. There are specific qualifications they must
achieve. If your apprentices donâ€™t already have these, they may
need to do an English or maths course.</p>
<p>You will need to work with your provider to identify which of
your apprentices require this training. We will pay providers
directly for the level 1 and 2 English and maths training they
provide to your apprentices. You wonâ€™t be asked to pay for
this.</p>
<p>We are seeking views on proposals that government pays providers
Â£471 for each level 2 English or maths qualification, continuing
the current funding rate we use for apprenticeship standards. You

<h2 id="eligibility-for-training">Eligibility for training</h2>
<h3 id="who-provides-the-training--all-employers">Who provides the
training â€“ all employers</h3>
<p>You can only spend the funds in your digital account or access
government support for apprenticeship training delivered by an
approved training provider.</p>
<p>The Skills Funding Agency is working with employers and
providers to identify what precise standards and measures are
important to them in selecting an apprenticeship training provider.
All training providers will need to show that they meet or exceed
these criteria to join the register of approved training providers
and receive digital payments or government funding to deliver
apprenticeship training.</p>
<h3 id="employers-wishing-to-become-training-providers">Employers
wishing to become training providers</h3>
<p>We recognise that employers can be extremely successful training
providers and we want to encourage those who want to take this
route to deliver high-quality apprenticeships. Read <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-become-a-training-provider">

apprenticeships training</a>.</p>
<h3 id="who-provides-assessment--all-employers">Who provides

<p>You can only spend the funds in your digital account or access
government support to pay for approved assessment organisations
that are listed on the <a href=
"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-apprentice-assessment-organisations">
Register of Apprenticeship Assessment Organisations</a>.
Organisations who wish to carry out end point assessments will need
to show that they meet or exceed certain criteria.</p>
<h3 id="employers-with-operations-across-the-uk">Employers with

<p id="employers-with-operations-across-uk">Education and training
is a devolved policy, which means that authorities in each of the
UK nations manage their own apprenticeship programmes. For
apprenticeships in England, you will be entitled to funding as
described here.</p>
<p>We know that some employers have cross-border operations and
training activity. We are working with the devolved administrations
to make this work for you. We are developing rules on which
employees and training providers you can use funds in your digital
account or government support to pay for. We are seeking views on
proposals that employers should be able to use their digital funds
and access government support for training employees whose main
workplace is England. You can <a href=
