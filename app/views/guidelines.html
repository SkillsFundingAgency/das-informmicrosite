				<p>Use the following guidance to set up and use your apprenticeship levy account.</p>

				<h2 id="manage-your-team" class="heading-large">Manage your team</h3>
				<p>You can assign different people to do different tasks within your account.</p>


				<h3 id="further-guidance" class="heading-medium">Account owner</h3>

				<p>If you set up the account, you’re the account owner.</p>
				<p>The account owner can: </p>

				<ul class="list list-bullet text">
				   <li> start and stop apprenticeships</li>
				    <li>  start and stop payments</li>
				     <li> sign new contracts with training providers</li>
				     <li> view all financial information, such as current balances and forecasts</li>
				     <li> add or remove PAYE schemes from the account</li>
				     <li> manage who has access to the account and what they can do</li>
				     <li> sign an SFA agreement on behalf of each organisation that has an account</li>
				</ul>


				<p>The account owner needs to sign the SFA agreement before the account can be used to hire apprentices.</p> 
				<p>The SFA agreement is a legal agreement that the account owner must sign on behalf of the organisation using the account.</p>
				<p>The SFA agreement must be signed in order for you to spend levy funds.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">People to manage apprenticeships</h3>

				<p>As the account owner, you can invite people to manage apprenticeships and payments within the account</p>
				<p>These people can:</p>
				<ul class="list list-bullet text">
				   <li>start and stop apprenticeships</li>
				      <li>start and stop payments</li>
				      <li>sign new contracts with training providers</li>
				      <li>view all financial information, such as current balances and forecasts</li>
				      </ul>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">View only access</h3>
				<p>As the account owner, you can invite people to view all financial aspects of the account. They won’t be able to change any information on the account.</p>

				<h2 id="access-funds-paye" class="heading-large">Accessing funds using your PAYE schemes</h2>
				<p>You need to add a PAYE to your account to claim funding from that PAYE scheme. You can set up your account using one or multiple PAYE schemes.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">Using multiple PAYE schemes</h3>

				<p>You need to choose:</p>

				<ul class="list list-bullet text">
				    <li>which PAYE schemes you'll use to claim levy funds</li>
				    <li>which of your organisations will spend these funds and hire apprentices</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="heading-medium">Examples:</h3>

				<h4 class="heading-small">One PAYE scheme and one organisation</h4>
				<p>You can add your PAYE scheme to the account, and add the organisation or company you want to send the funding to.</p>

				<h4 class="heading-small">3 PAYE schemes and 1 organisation</h4>
				<p>You can add 3 PAYE schemes to the account, and add the organisation or company you want to send the funding to.</p>

				<h4 class="heading-small">3 PAYE schemes and 3 organisations</h4>
				<p>You can add 3 PAYE schemes to the account, and add whichever 3 organisations or companies you want to send the funding to.</p>

				<h4 class="heading-small">6 PAYE schemes and 3 organisations</h4>
				<p>You can add 6 PAYE schemes to the account, and add whichever 3 organisations or companies you want to send the funding to. </p>
